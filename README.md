# speckleGenetino
Play on words: Speckle Generator + Tino = SpeckleGenetino
A sample script to create speckle patterns like the following one:

The script is parameterised according to three variables:
  - pattern size: the size of the circles that need to be drawn
  - density: how compact the speckle dots are. Should go between 0 (very loose) to 1 (very compact)
  - variance: how random the dots are included, this goes from very uniform (0), to very random (1)

A sample image with 0.85 mm dots, 40% density and 100% noise:

Happy generatin'
